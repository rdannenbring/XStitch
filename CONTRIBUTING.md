# Contributing to XStitch

We love your input! We want to make contributing to XStitch as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

-   Reporting a bug
-   Discussing the current state of the code
-   Submitting a fix
-   Proposing new features
-   Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, and to accept pull requests.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/google-deepmind/xstitch-chrome-extension/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

-   A quick summary and/or background
-   Steps to reproduce
    -   Be specific!
    -   Give sample code if you can.
-   What you expected would happen
-   What actually happened
-   Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

-   Use 2 spaces for indentation.
-   Use TypeScript for all new logic.
-   Follow the existing project structure.
